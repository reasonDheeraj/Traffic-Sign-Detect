# Traffic-Sign-Detect
Detecting the traffic sign boards on a road or highway with size based algorithm.

This project presents an automatic road sign detection and recognition system that is based on a computational model of human visual recognition processing. Road signs are typically placed either by the roadside or above roads. They provide important information for guiding, warning, or regulating the behaviours drivers in order to make driving safer and easier. The proposed recognition system is motivated by human recognition processing. The sensory analyzer extracts the spatial and temporal information of interest from video sequences. The extracted boundaries information then serves as the input to area analyser which then searches for particular shapes in image. Later these detected objects are fed into a neural network. Potential features of road signs are then extracted from the object areas corresponding to the focuses and the neural network decides which traffic sign it is . After this the sign is recognized and the detected sign board is displayed to driver.
